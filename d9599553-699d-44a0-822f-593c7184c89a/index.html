held before us as sword and shield we cut a mighty swath through retailers

never pinching, or getting too tight when his hand swelled. His old ring took cold water and some
judicious use of dish soap to get off, and even then some skin had to be sacrificed.
The Enso ring was Husband approved. </p><p>Then I gave it the once over. It looked good. Low profile and sleek with detailing for added
interest and a glossy finish. It vaguely reminded me of a sports car… sort
of.Regardless of its ability to go 0 to
60 in 2.4 seconds it checked all the boxes. The ring got Wife approved. The
Enso ring was like his favorite pair of pants, he liked them because they are
comfortable and he can go from the office to hiking, I liked them because they
look nice and make his butt look cute. </p><p>The ring looked so nice in fact that I decided I might need
one. That one turned into five. What can I say? I’m fickle and really, why be
tied down to one color?The stackable
Enso rings sort of remind me of maxi skirts.They are stylish, adaptable and so dressy no one knows you are basically
